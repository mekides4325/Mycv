        <p>1.Does it matter to use relative size
            (%em,rem) one styling the size of an element
             so that the element is responsive? why? </p>
<br><p>Yes it matters.Because Using em for font size can be tricky.
     The exact value is determined by the element's inherited font 
     size or from the font size of the parent element. This gets 
     complicated when nesting elements more deeply. 
     If an element has a font size in em, its parent has a font 
     size in em, and its parent has yet another. so to determine the actual 
     computed value of the child element we will have 
     to multiply all these values.<br>
     rem stands for “Root em”. It is a relative unit of CSS and translated by
     the browser to pixels (px). When rem is used on the font-size in the root
      element, it represents its initial value.Because the content should adjust 
      to the size of the device. 

      If we want to keep the font-size responsive to the device, then we must change the root html element.

                <p>2. we said 16px is default browser width so
                    what does it mean when we say 200px?
                How does the browser interpret that</p><br>
                <p>when we say the default width of the browser is 16px we mean that its intial 100% width is 16px.And then when we say 200px
                    we mean that the default 16px will be changed to 200px.Its all for calculation purpose.
                <br>it simply means changing<br> 100%=16px into 100%=200px</p>

                <section  class="blog">
                   
                    <article id="a3">
                        <p>3.Explain in detail(in technical terms) the
        specific change in css3</p><br>
       <h4>3.1 CSS 3 Selectors</h4><br><p>In addition to the selectors 
            that were available in CSS2, CSS 3 introduces some 
            new selectors. Using these selectors you can choose DOM
     elements based on their attributes. So you don't need to specify 
     classes and IDs for every element. Instead, you can utilize the 
     attribute field to style them.<br></p>
     The most useful attributes for selectors are:<ul>
     <li>[attr^=val] Â- matches a DOM element with the attribute attr and a value starting with val</li>
     <li></li>[attr$=val] Â- matches a DOM element with the attribute attr and a value ending with the suffix val</li>
     <li></li>[attr*=val] Â- matches a DOM element with the attribute attr and a value containing the substring val</li>
    </ul>
<br><h4>3.2 CSS 3 Rounded Corners</h4><br><p>
Rounded corner elements can spruce up a website, but creating a rounded corner requires a designer to write a lot of code. Adjusting the height, width and positioning of these elements is a never-ending chore because any change in content can break them.

CSS 3 addresses this problem by introducing the border-radius property, which gives the same rounded-corner effect and it doesn't has to be written all the code.
</p><br>
<h4>3.3 CSS 3 Border Image</h4><br>
<p>Another exciting feature in CSS 3 is the ability to swap out a border with an image. The property border-image allows to specify an image to display instead of a plain solid-colored border.</p>
                    
<br><h4>3.4 CSS 3 Box Shadow</h4><br>
<p> A box shadow allows to create a drop shadow for an element. Usually this effect is achieved using a repeated image around the element. However, with the property box-shadow this can be achieved by writing a single line of CSS code.</p>



<br><h4>3.5 CSS 3 Text Shadow</h4><br><p>
    The new text-shadow property allows you to add drop shadows to the text on a webpage. Prior to CSS 3, this would be done by either using an image or duplicating a text element and then positioning it.</p>

<br><h4>3.6 CSS 3 Gradient</h4><br>
<p>While the Gradient effect is a sleek Web design tool, it can be a drain on resources if not implemented correctly using current CSS techniques. Some designers use a complete image and put in the background for the gradient effect, which increases the page load time.</p>

<br><h4>3.7 CSS 3 RGBA: Color, Now with Opacity</h4><br>
<p>The RGB property in CSS is used to set colors for different elements. CSS 3 introduces a modification and added opacity manipulation to this property. RGB has been transformed to RGBA (Red Green Blue Alpha channels), which simplifies how you control the opacity of elements.
<br><h4>3.8 CSS 3 Transform (Element Rotation)</h4><br>
<P>CSS 3 also introduced a property called transform, which enables rotating Web elements on a webpage. As of now, if a designer wants to rotate of an element, he or she uses JavaScript. Many JavaScript extensions/plugins are available online for this feature, but they can make the code cumbersome and most importantly consume more resources.</P>
</p>
<br><h4>3.9 CSS 3 Multicolumn Layout</h4><br>
<p>Almost every webpage today is divided into columns or boxes, and adjusting these boxes so they display correctly on different browsers takes a toll on Web designers. CSS 3 solves this problem with the multicolumn layout property; all you have to do is specify the number of columns you need and they will be created.

    This property is currently supported by the Firefox and WebKit browsers.</p>

<br><h4>3.10 CSS 3 Web Fonts</h4><br>
<p>CSS 3 also facilitates embedding any custom font on a webpage. Fonts are dependent on the client system and Web pages can render only fonts that are supported by the browser or the client machine. By using the @font-face property, you can include the font from a remote location and can then use it.</p>
